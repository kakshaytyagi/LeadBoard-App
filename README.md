## Overview

Welcome to Lead, an advanced lead management app designed to streamline lead tracking, follow-ups, and communication. Lead is built using Flutter for the frontend, offering a smooth and intuitive user experience, and Firebase for the backend, ensuring seamless data management and real-time updates. This document serves as a comprehensive guide for developers and users to understand the key functionalities and setup of the Lead Management App.

## Features

1. **Lead Tracking**: Easily track and manage leads across various categories such as commercial, industrial, rental, residential, and others.
2. **Follow-up Management**: Maintain detailed records of follow-up interactions, including conversation logs, timestamps, and follow-up schedules.
3. **WhatsApp Integration**: Initiate follow-up conversations directly from the app using WhatsApp, without saving contacts to the phone.

5. **Contact Management**: Seamlessly save contacts to the app from existing phone contacts or speed dial, ensuring easy access and organization.
6. **Live Updates**: Receive real-time updates on lead status, including active, dead, and follow-up progress.
